# nonlinear-diffusion-growing-domains
This repository contains a Matlab script that can generate the results presented in "Exact sharp-fronted solutions
%% for nonlinear diffusion on evolving domains" by Johnston and Simpson, 2023. The code simply enumerates the expressions
derived in the manuscript. The default parameters in the code generate the solution profiles in red in Figures 1(a)-(b).
The parameters can be changed to generate other solutions.
